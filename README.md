# The Vehicle Service Management System (CDAC Project)

#### Introduction:

Welcome to the Git repository for my CDAC Post Graduate Project, The Vehicle Service Management System! This repository serves as a central hub for all the code, documentation, and resources related to the development of a website aimed at facilitating customers and authorized vehicle service centers. The main objective of this project is to provide a platform where customers can browse service center information, view offers, book service slots, and track servicing status. This introduction will provide an overview of the project and guide you through the contents and structure of this repository.

#### Project Overview:

The Vehicle Service Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of car servicing for customers and authorized vehicle service centers. The primary focus is to provide an easy-to-use interface for customers to find service centers, view service offerings and offers, and conveniently book service slots. Additionally, the system allows customers to track the status of their servicing requests. By leveraging technologies such as Spring Boot REST API, Java, React.js, MySQL and JPA, this project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly solution.

#### Repository Structure:

This Git repository is organized into several directories and files, each serving a specific purpose. Here's a brief description of the main components:

1. Backend: This directory contains the source code and documentation related to the backend of the system. It includes the implementation of the Spring Boot REST API, data models, service logic, and database configurations. The code is written in Java and utilizes JPA for database operations. Detailed documentation is provided to assist with understanding the backend architecture and functionality.

2. Frontend: Here, you will find the source code and documentation related to the frontend of the application. The frontend is built using React.js, and this directory contains components, pages, stylesheets, and other necessary files for the user interface. The frontend code is well-documented, making it easier to understand and modify.

3. Database: This directory includes the necessary database schema and scripts to set up the MySQL database for the Vehicle Service Management System. It provides the necessary instructions and guidelines for database initialization and configuration.

4. Documentation: This section contains comprehensive documentation related to the project. It includes the project proposal, requirements specification, design documents, user guides, and technical reports. The documentation provides a detailed understanding of the system's functionality, architecture, and usage instructions.

<!-- The main objective of this project is to build a website that will help customers and authorized vehicle service centers. Customers will be able to browse the service centerâ€™s information, and view offers provided by the service centers. Customers can book service slots after login, and could track servicing status. Customers may do business for car service easily and comfortably. -->
