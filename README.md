# The-Vehicle-Service-Management-System (CDAC Project)

The main objective of this project is to build a website that will help customers and authorized vehicle service centers. Customers will be able to browse the service centerâ€™s information, and view offers provided by the service centers. Customers can book service slots after login, and could track servicing status. Customers may do business for car service easily and comfortably.
